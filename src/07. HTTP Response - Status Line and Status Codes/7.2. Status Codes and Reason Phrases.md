# Status Codes and Reason Phrases

The **Status Code** is the number that tells you if the request succeeded or failed, while the **Reason Phrase** explains what happened. These codes fall into five main categories:

<div align="center">

[100-199](#informational-responses-100-199) |
[200-299](#successful-responses-200-299) |
[300-399](#redirection-messages-300-399) |
[400-499](#client-error-responses-400-499) |
[500-599](#server-error-responses-500-599)

</div>

### Informational Responses (100-199)

These codes mean the server has received part of the request and is waiting for the rest. It’s a "keep going" signal.

These codes mean everything worked as expected. The server processed the request and sent back the requested data.

### Client Error Responses (400-499)

These codes indicate a problem with the request. Maybe the URL is wrong, or you’re missing some required info, like authentication.

### Server Error Responses (500-599)

These codes mean the server encountered an error while trying to fulfil the request. These are usually server-side issues and not the client’s fault.
