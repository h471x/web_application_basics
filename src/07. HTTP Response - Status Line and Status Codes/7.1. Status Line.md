When you interact with a web application, the server sends back an HTTP response to let you know whether your request was successful or something went wrong. These responses include a status code and a short explanation (called the Reason Phrase) that gives insight into how the server handled your request.

## Status Line

The first line in every HTTP response is called the Status Line. It gives you three key pieces of info:

- HTTP Version: This tells you which version of HTTP is being used.
- Status Code: A three-digit number showing the outcome of your request.
- Reason Phrase: A short message explaining the status code in human-readable terms.

Since we already covered HTTP Versions in [Request Line and Methods](../5.%20HTTP%20Request%20-%20Request%20Line%20and%20Methods/5.1.%20HTTP%20Request.md), letâ€™s focus on the **Status Codes** and **Reason Phrases** here.
