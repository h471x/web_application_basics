# URL Path

The **URL path** tells the server where to find the resource the user is asking for. For instance, in the URL ``https://tryhackme.com/api/users/123``, the path ``/api/users/123`` identifies a specific user.

Attackers often try to manipulate the URL path to exploit vulnerabilities, so itâ€™s crucial to:

- Validate the URL path to prevent unauthorised access
- Sanitise the path to avoid injection attacks
- Protect sensitive data by conducting privacy and risk assessments
- Following these practices helps protect your web application from common attacks.
