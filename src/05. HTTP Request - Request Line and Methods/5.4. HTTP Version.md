# HTTP Version

The **HTTP version** shows the protocol version used to communicate between the client and server. Here’s a quick rundown of the most common ones:

<div align="center">

[v0.9](#http09-1991) |
[v1.0](#http10-1996) |
[v1.1](#http11-1997) |
[v2](#http2-2015) |
[v3](#http3-2022)

### HTTP/0.9 (1991)

The first version, only supported GET requests.

### HTTP/1.0 (1996)

Added headers and better support for different types of content, improving caching.

### HTTP/1.1 (1997)

Brought persistent connections, chunked transfer encoding, and better caching. It’s still widely used today.

### HTTP/2 (2015)

Introduced features like multiplexing, header compression, and prioritisation for faster performance.

### HTTP/3 (2022)

Built on HTTP/2, but uses a new protocol (QUIC) for quicker and more secure connections.

Although **HTTP/2** and **HTTP/3** offer better speed and security, many systems ``still use HTTP/1.1`` because it’s **well-supported** and **works with most existing setups**.

However, **upgrading** to HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 can provide significant performance and security improvements as more systems adopt them.
