# Referrer-Policy

This header controls the amount of information sent to the destination web server when a user is redirected from the source web server, such as when they click a hyperlink. The header is available to allow a web administrator to control what information is shared.  Here are some examples of Referrer-Policy:

- ``Referrer-Policy: no-referrer``
- ``Referrer-Policy: same-origin``
- ``Referrer-Policy: strict-origin``
- ``Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin``

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the Referrer-Policy header by directives:

- **no-referrer**
  - This completely disables any information being sent about the referrer

- **same-origin**
  - This policy will only send referrer information when the destination is part of the same origin. This is helpful when you want referrer information passed when hyperlinks are within the same website but not outside to external websites.

- **strict-origin**
  - This policy only sends the referrer as the origin when the protocol stays the same. So, a referrer is sent when an HTTPS connection goes to another HTTPS connection.

- **strict-origin-when-cross-origin**
  - This is similar to strict-origin except for same-origin requests, where it sends the full URL path in the origin header.
