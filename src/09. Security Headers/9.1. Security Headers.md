# Security Headers

HTTP Security Headers help improve the overall security of the web application by providing mitigations against attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and others. We will now dig deeper into the following security headers:

- Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Referrer-Policy

You can use a site like [https://securityheaders.io/](https://securityheaders.io/) to analyse the security headers of any website. After the discussion in this task, you will hopefully have a better understanding of what it is reporting on.
