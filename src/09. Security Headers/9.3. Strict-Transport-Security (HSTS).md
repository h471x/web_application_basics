# Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)

The HSTS header ensures that web browsers will always connect over HTTPS. Let's look at an example of HSTS:

```http
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload
```

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the example HSTS header by directive:

- **max-age**
  - This is the expiry time in seconds for this setting

- **includeSubDomains**
  - An optional setting that instructs the browser to also apply this setting to all subdomains.

- **preload**
  - This optional setting allows the website to be included in preload lists. Browsers can use preload lists to enforce HSTS before even having their first visit to a website.
