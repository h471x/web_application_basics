## URL key components:

<div align="center">

[Scheme](#scheme) |
[User](#user) |
[Host/Domain](#hostdomain) |
[Port](#port) |
[Path](#path) |
[Query String](#query-string) |
[Fragment](#fragment)

</div>

### Scheme

The scheme is the protocol used to access the website. The most common are **HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and **HTTPS** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). HTTPS is more secure because it encrypts the connection, which is why browsers and cyber security experts recommend it. Websites often enforce HTTPS for added protection.


> **HTTP**  
> Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol that specifies how a web browser and a web server communicate. Your web browser requests content from the TryHackMe web server using the HTTP protocol as you go through this room.

### User

Some URLs can include a user’s login details (usually a username) for sites that require authentication. This happens mostly in URLs that need credentials to access certain resources. However, it’s rare nowadays because putting login details in the URL isn’t very safe—it can expose sensitive information, which is a security risk.

### Host/Domain

The **host** or **domain** is the most important part of the URL because it tells you which website you’re accessing. Every domain name has to be unique and is registered through domain registrars. From a security standpoint, look for domain names that appear almost like real ones but have small differences (this is called **typosquatting**). These fake domains are often used in phishing attacks to trick people into giving up sensitive info.

### Port

The **port number** helps direct your browser to the right service on the web server. It’s like telling the server which doorway to use for communication. Port numbers range from 1 to 65,535, but the most common are 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.

### Path

The **path** points to the specific file or page on the server that you’re trying to access. It’s like a roadmap that shows the browser where to go. Websites need to secure these paths to make sure only authorised users can access sensitive resources.

### Query String

The **query string** is the part of the URL that starts with a question mark (?). It’s often used for things like search terms or form inputs. Since users can modify these query strings, it’s important to handle them securely to prevent attacks like **injections**, where malicious code could be added.

### Fragment

The **fragment** starts with a hash symbol (#) and helps point to a specific section of a webpage—like jumping directly to a particular heading or table. Users can modify this too, so like with query strings, it’s important to check and clean up any data here to avoid issues like injection attacks.
