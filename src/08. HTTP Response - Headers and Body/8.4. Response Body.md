# Response Body

The **HTTP response body** is where the actual data livesâ€”things like HTML, JSON, images, etc., that the server sends back to the client. To prevent **injection attacks** like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), always sanitise and escape any data (especially user-generated content) before including it in the response.

> **XSS** is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. It allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can then steal sensitive information, like user's cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive data.
