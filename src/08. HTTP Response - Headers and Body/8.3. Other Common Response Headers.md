# Other Common Response Headers

Besides the essential ones, there are other common headers that give additional instructions to the client or browser and help control how the response should be handled.

- **Set-Cookie**:
  Example: ``Set-Cookie: sessionId=38af1337es7a8``
  This one sends cookies from the server to the client, which the client then stores and sends back with future requests. To keep things secure, make sure cookies are set with the HttpOnly flag (so they can’t be accessed by JavaScript) and the Secure flag (so they’re only sent over HTTPS).

- **Cache-Control**:
  Example: ``Cache-Control: max-age=600``
  This header tells the client how long it can cache the response before checking with the server again. It can also prevent sensitive info from being cached if needed (using no-cache).

- **Location**:
  Example: ``Location: /index.html``
  This one’s used in redirection (3xx) responses. It tells the client where to go next if the resource has moved. If users can modify this header during requests, be careful to validate and sanitise it—otherwise, you could end up with open redirect vulnerabilities, where attackers can redirect users to harmful sites.
