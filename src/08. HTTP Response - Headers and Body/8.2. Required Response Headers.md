# Required Response Headers

Some response headers are crucial for making sure the HTTP response works properly. They provide essential info that both the client and server need to process everything correctly. Here are a few important ones:

<br>

- **Date**:

  Example: ``Date: Fri, 23 Aug 2024 10:43:21 GMT``
  This header shows the exact date and time when the response was generated by the server.

<br>

- **Content-Type**:

  Example: ``Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8``
  It tells the client what kind of content it’s getting, like whether it’s HTML, JSON, or something else. It also includes the character set (like UTF-8) to help the browser display it properly.

<br>

- **Server**:

  Example: ``Server: nginx``
  This header shows what kind of server software is handling the request. It’s good for debugging, but it can also reveal server information that might be useful for attackers, so many people remove or obscure this one.
